          I'm a student developer, always eager to learn new things, especially
          when it comes to the backend. I developed my own style for my
          projects. I love clean, minimalistic and sleek design when it comes to
          the frontend. It's also adaptable to other styles and it makes things
          instantly look professional.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          But my true passion rests in the backend and engineering. I still have
          much to learn, but making things functional and secure is something
          very satisfying. Whether it's making a bot, tool, website or any other
          application, I'm ready for any project and love to challenge myself.

              ‚öæ I love watching and playing baseball. One day I'd love to be a
              proficient catcher!
            </p>
            <p>
              üèâ Not only do I love baseball, but playing rugby is also very
              fun!
            </p>
            <p>
              üèùÔ∏è My habitat is the sand, sea and palm trees. Loving water
              activities and enjoying slow, comfortable days.
            </p>
            <p>‚õ∞Ô∏è Hiking and mountain climbing is awesome!</p>
            <p>
              üìñ When I'm not physically active, I love to read philosophy and
              practicing it in life itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              üî≠ I truly love science! Whether it's about the stars, the ocean,

            <p>
              üë®‚Äçüíª And of course is programming a big part of my life. I work on
